**One of the core features of Django's stack is loose coupling and tight cohesion, following Encapsulation principles.**

In Computer Science, coupling is related to the degree of interdependence that exists between software modules and how closely they are connected to each other.

Tight coupling means the modules are deeply connected and interdependent. This is considered bad design, like a puzzle system. Loose coupling, means the components know little or only enough about each other when absolutely necessary and yet can work well together, like a lego system.

Cohesion is related to the interdependency within the module, amongst its elements, forming a single cohesive unit.

Quoted from "Boulder Patterns Group Minutes Old"
>the correct terminology is "tight internal cohesion" and "loose external coupling". This basically means that each method in a class should have one task and the class as a whole should have one major responsibility (tight internal cohesion) and that other classes should not depend on the inner workings of this class but should be designed to the "interface" of the class (loose external coupling). See a recent post by AlanShalloway on this: [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/dpexplained/message/108]

**An example of loose coupling and tight cohesion in Django is that the template system doesn't know about Web requests, the database layer knows nothing about how the data will be displayed and the view system allows for any template system a programmer uses.**

If one wants to use the REST framework approach, that is possible and the view can be handled by another application written in React or Vue, for example.

This allows Django to be flexible, reusable and maintainable. Keeping modules simple is fundamental. (KISS)

## Don‚Äôt repeat yourself (DRY)

Django follows the DRY principle, making it easy to avoid repeating code, since modules are reusable and not bloated, as previously stated.

The framework deduce as much as possible from as little as possible.

## Explicit is better than implicit

This is a core Python principle listed in PEP 20, and it means Django shouldn‚Äôt do too much ‚Äúmagic.‚Äù Magic shouldn‚Äôt happen unless there‚Äôs a really good reason for it

For example, in Django Models, fields shouldn‚Äôt assume certain behaviors based solely on the name of the field. This requires too much knowledge of the system and is prone to errors. Instead, behaviors should be based on keyword arguments and, in some cases, on the type of the field.
